## Pirate Translator

The inspiration for this app popped up when our team came across the Pirate API on the internet. We figured it would be a pretty cool way to learn the basics of Flask, Python and using APIs
## What it does
The webapp we built takes in input from the user, and prints out how a pirate would say the same thing. 
## How we built it
We built the app in Flask, Python and HTML.
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into was actually building the whole thing. None of us had any prior experience building webapps, nor knew how to code fluently in any of the languages we used. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud of the frontend, as we spent the most time to make it look at least decent. We tried out a bunch of different frameworks before we settled on Flask, and it did all work out in the end. 
## What we learned
It has been a really fun learning experience to stay up all night watching tutorials, munching on free food, watching tutorials and botching together code snippets praying that it works. 
## What's next for Pirate Translator
The next thing I would do to this is add more functionality. Our initial idea was to allow the user to choose between a pirate, yoda or groot but unfortunately, we could not go that far. So, that would be the next step.
